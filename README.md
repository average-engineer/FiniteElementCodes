# FiniteElementCodes
Basic Scripts written for illustrating concepts of the Finite Element Method

All scripts inspired from the lecture material of the course 'Advanced Finite Element Method', which I took in the first semester of my master's degree at RWTH Aachen University and 'Finite Element Methods in Lightweight Design' which I took in the seond second semester.
